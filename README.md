# ChatMood :speech_balloon: :bar_chart:

ChatMood is an innovative web application that not only analyzes and visualizes WhatsApp chat data, but also delves into the nuances of conversation sentiments. It leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to make sense of both English and 'Hinglish' (a hybrid of Hindi and English) conversations. 

Powered by NLP, ChatMood transforms the raw chat data into meaningful insights by processing the text through tokenization, where sentences are broken down into individual words or 'tokens'. Then, it applies lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., 'running' to 'run'), ensuring that variations of a word are analyzed as a single item. It also removes 'stop words' - common words like 'is', 'at', 'which', and 'on' that usually carry little meaningful information.

The key highlight of ChatMood is its advanced sentiment analysis. The application assigns a sentiment score ranging from 0 (most negative) to 10 (most positive) to the overall chat and to each individual user. In a unique feature, it can also handle 'Hinglish' conversations. It achieves this by manually assigning sentiment scores from 0 to 1 to commonly used 'Hinglish' words, based on the emotions they typically express. This enables ChatMood to capture the sentiment of conversations in a bilingual context, making it truly versatile and inclusive.
