# ChatMood :speech_balloon: :bar_chart:

ChatMood is an innovative web application that not only analyzes and visualizes WhatsApp chat data, but also delves into the nuances of conversation sentiments. It leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to make sense of both English and 'Hinglish' (a hybrid of Hindi and English) conversations. 

Powered by NLP, ChatMood transforms the raw chat data into meaningful insights. It begins by tokenizing the sentences into individual words, then applies lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form, thereby ensuring that different forms of the same word are analyzed together. It also removes 'stop words' - common words like 'is', 'at', 'which', and 'on' that usually carry little meaningful information, to focus on the meaningful parts of the conversation.

The standout feature of ChatMood is its unique sentiment analysis. This app expertly handles 'Hinglish' conversations. It uses a special lexicon file where individual 'Hinglish' words are manually scored from 0 to 1 based on the emotions they represent. By reading and applying these scores, ChatMood effectively captures the sentiment of bilingual conversations, showcasing its versatility and inclusivity.
